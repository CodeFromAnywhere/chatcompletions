# Pricing structure

0.001175 per MB per year with 1000 requests.
To generate with 200k Million input/output tokens (to get 1mb) it would cost at least 3.6 cents.
Therefore the storage is much cheaper than the generation.

Therefore, for the storage I can probably charge 1 cent per megatoken and still be fine.
