Make me a vanilla HTML + cdn.tailwindcss.com + CSS + JS website with the following requirements:

- everything is always stored as much as possible in localStorage and editable in settings
- for icons, use font awesome from https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.0.0-beta3/css/all.min.css
- If possible, add a share button that uses twitter intent to share the website with a nice caption
- if the user provides a api management url, add a link to open it (in a new tab) so the user can easily get their key there
- ensure to use add clear loading indicators
- always respond with a full new HTML page in a HTML codeblock
