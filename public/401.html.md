Make a website in HTML, JS and CSS (import tailwind from tailwind.js) for a 401 page for "Chat Completions".

Pretend to be a 100x developer, making the best possible design and code.

- The URL structure of this page is `/from/[contextUrl]/base/[llmBasePath]/model/[llmModelName]/prompt/[prompt]/output.[ext]`.
- When initialising the page, prefil the fields from here (ensure to apply urldecoding).
- Also fetch `/providers.json` and use that as data.

Show this form:

- Fields: basePath, model, api key, context url, prompt, ext
- Aggregate all models from all providers in a select box that prefill the model and basePath
- After selecting one of the selectbox, it should show a link 'Get a key for [providerName]' that leads to the apiKeyUrl in a new tab.
- The field 'model' should be fully customisable besides selecting it from the boxes
- All fields are required
- ext can be any of md/json/yaml/csv/xml/html
- Add a checkbox that is required that lets user accept 'required cookies', privacy policy, and terms of service (available at `/privacy.html` and `/tos.html`)

When submitting, direct the user to the url structure seen above, but filled in.
